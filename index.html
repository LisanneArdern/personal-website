        <h2>Some information about me</h2>
        <p>After graduating from high school, I wanted to see something of the world before deciding which direction I wanted to take professionally. 
            My journey started in Mexico, where I took a Spanish language course. 
            After that, I started an internship in Buenos Aires, Argentina in marketing. 
            During these months I fell in love with Latin America and its diversity in many ways.
        </p>
        <p>On my return to Germany, I began my studies in International Tourism Management. 
            After completing my studies and gaining my first professional experience in Germany, I returned to the country I had fallen in love with a few years before- Mexico. 
        </p>
        <p>From March 2018 to November 2020, I lived and worked in Mexico City. 
            In between, I travelled for a few months in Peru and Colombia, where I worked on a voluntary basis. 
            The stay abroad was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. 
            I was able to learn a lot about myself, I developed as a person and I got to know many wonderful people and cultures.
