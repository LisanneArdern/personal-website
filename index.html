        <h2>Some information about me</h2>
        <p>
          After graduating from high school, I wanted to see something of the
          world before deciding which direction I wanted to take professionally.
          My journey started in Mexico, where I took a Spanish language course.
          After that, I started an internship in Buenos Aires, Argentina in
          marketing. During these months I fell in love with Latin America and
          its diversity in many ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          On my return to Germany, I began my studies in International Tourism
          Management. After completing my studies and gaining my first
          professional experience in Germany, I returned to the country I had
          fallen in love with a few years before- Mexico.
        </p>
        <p>
          From March 2018 to November 2020, I lived and worked in Mexico City.
          In between, I travelled for a few months in Peru and Colombia, where I
          worked on a voluntary basis. The stay abroad was one of the most
          amazing experiences I have ever had. I was able to learn a lot about
          myself, I developed as a person and I got to know many wonderful
          people and cultures.
